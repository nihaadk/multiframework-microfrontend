# Microfrontend Demo with Angular, React, and Web Components

This project demonstrates different approaches to building and integrating Microfrontends using Angular, React, and Web Components.  
It contains three main parts:

## 1. Angular Host & Angular Remote
- Setup of a Host Angular application.  
- Setup of a Remote Angular application.  
- Integration of the Remote app into the Host app using Module Federation.  

## 2. React Remote integrated into Angular Host
- Setup of a React Remote application (as WebComponent).  
- Exposure of React components via Module Federation.  
- Loading and rendering the React Remote inside the Angular Host app.  

## 3. Web Component Library
- Creation of a Web Component library (e.g., with Angular Elements or Stencil).  
- Integration of the Web Components into both Angular and React applications.
